Here are just a few thoughts for those who are more visual learners (and/or have trouble with my accent) to help us play together on the same page. Unfortunately, I can't crete plays with decision based options so I've created 1A, 1B etc to show variations.
  I've included responsibilities for each player to but I obviosuly cvan't cover all eventualities. The goal is to play well together and have fun.

  Let me know if you have any thoughts or questions.
